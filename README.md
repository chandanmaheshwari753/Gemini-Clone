# Gemini Clone

## Description

Gemini Clone is a React-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the Gemini API by submitting prompts. The application sends user-input prompts to the Gemini API and displays the responses directly on the frontend. This project demonstrates my ability to build a user-friendly interface that integrates with an external API.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can enter prompts into a text input field.
- **API Integration**: Submits the user's prompts to the Gemini API.
- **Response Display**: Displays the API response on the frontend in a clear and organized manner.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling
